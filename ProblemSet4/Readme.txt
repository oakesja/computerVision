My over all experience was that this problem set went well. At first I did not understand how to find the scale with the RMS to normalize point but that was clear up
quickly. Everything else was pretty straight forward. I found the shed_diary.txt very helpful. It made it a lot easier to go through the shed at first and then 
switch over to using the myers pictures and points.
