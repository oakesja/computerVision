The first part of this project went fairly well. The only part that was confusing in it was the notation for the 3rd part of them being row vectors
not column vectors.

The texture part was very difficult. After the class where we went over it again, I was able to rectify the images fairly easily. 
Actually getting the texture coordinates were a little tricky and took some time for me to figure out how to do it. 
Also for some reason any time I made a change to my 3d model I had to completely close matlab to visibly see that change. 

I was able to finish it in the end though.
