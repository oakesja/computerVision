For the mosaics I picked the points between the pair of pictures that I thought were the best. For the quad I used the ones right next to each other.
Once I found these I found the homography to map them to each other. From there I picked picture 6 as the reference and mapped all the pictures to it
by multiplying matrices. 

NOTE: I didn't read the instructions close enough so that's why I did both the quad and the Wislon North.

For the rectification I first found the x vector by subtracting the two camera centers and normalizing them. Then I was able to find the y vectors by
crossing it with the third row of each rotation vector. Then the z vector was just the y and x vectors crossed. The new rotation matrix is just 
these vectors as row vectors. 

To rectify it you have to undo the camera calbrations and rotation matrices and then apply the new rotation matrix and any camera matrix.
