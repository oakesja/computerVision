Both transformations take the tiles and make the lines of the square parallel again.
The rectify direct goes further and removes all projective distortion and makes the tiles square again which is what is done to the first image. 
The second image used an affine transformation that moved the line of infinity back to where it is supposed to be. This removed all of the 
prospective distortion except for skew which is why the tiles look like trapezoids.
